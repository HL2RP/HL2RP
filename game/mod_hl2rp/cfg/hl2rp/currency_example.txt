// Currency setup. Configures the prop features tied to designated amounts (keys), for dropping money.
// The attributes within each amount are normal entity KeyValues, to freely customize the props.
// Dropping will iteratively spawn props, consuming the higher configured amounts first, until no money remains.
// If too much props are required, the server will limit them and add the remaining amount to the first one.
