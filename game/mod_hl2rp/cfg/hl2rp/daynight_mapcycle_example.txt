// Season and day/night mapcycle setup.
// Seasons are loaded from seasons.txt. "Default" section will apply when not running a configured season IRL.
// In case of overlaps, priority is given to the earlier declared season in the main file (top-down order).
// Map groups listed here must belong to mapgroups.txt. Mapcycles will be loaded and merged for all active groups.
// This means map changes will still trigger from maps not specified here, but tied to any loaded group.
// Also, for simplicity, maps listed here don't have to belong to their specified group. Just ensure it manually.
